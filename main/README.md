# Where's them codez? 🤷‍♂️

The main code lives in the [atom-ide-mocha-core][] monorepo.

Atom requires all packages to have their own repository, and it does not support compilation on publish time due to their architectural decisions so I decided to publish all the code to npm and then just install it as a dependency here.
